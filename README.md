# loan-approval-eda
Exploratory Data Analysis on a loan approval classification dataset.

# Objective
Analyze loan application data to discover patterns affecting loan approvals.

# Key Findings
- Credit score has a strong positive correlation with loan approval.
- Higher loan amounts, interest rates, and loan-to-income ratios are associated with rejections.
- Most applicants are Bachelor's degree holders with entry/junior-level experience.
- Applicants with previous loan defaults are more likely to be rejected.

# Implications
Financial reliability indicators (credit score, debt ratio) are crucial for approval. These insights will inform feature selection for predictive modeling.

# Limitations
Some missing data and class imbalance may impact modeling accuracy.

# Next Steps
- Clean missing data
- Encode categorical features
- Train ML models to predict loan approval
